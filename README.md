# Analysis-of-Bounce-Rate-and-User-Engagement-Understanding-Website-Viewing-Behavior

# Objective:
The bounce rate is a key performance indicator in web analytics that represents the percentage of visitors who land on a webpage and leave without further interaction. A high bounce rate may indicate issues with user experience, content relevance, or website performance, whereas a low bounce rate suggests better visitor engagement.

Given a dataset containing bounce rate, session duration, and other user behavior metrics, the objective is to analyze user engagement patterns and uncover insights that can help improve website retention

# Areas of Analysis:
1)Overall Bounce Rate Evaluation: What is the average bounce rate of the website, and how does it compare to industry benchmarks?

2)Relationship Between Bounce Rate and Session Duration: Are there identifiable trends showing how session duration affects the bounce rate?

3)User Segmentation and Behavioral Patterns: Can we segment users based on their browsing behavior to understand different bounce rate trends?
